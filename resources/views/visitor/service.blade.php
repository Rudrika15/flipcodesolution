                            <p>Data-driven organizations often use the terms "business intelligence" (BI) and "data
                                analytics" interchangeably. They're not the same thing, but if someone asked you to explain
                                the difference, what would you say?</p>
                            <p>Some people distinguish between the two by saying that business intelligence looks backward
                                at historical data to describe things that have happened, while data analytics uses data
                                science techniques to predict what will or should happen in the future. We think that's
                                close, but there's more to it.</p>
                            <p>Business intelligence involves the use of data to help make business decisions, or as
                                OLAP.com puts it, BI "refers to technologies, applications, and practices for the
                                collection, integration, analysis, and presentation of business information. The purpose of
                                business intelligence is to support better business decision-making." However, one could say
                                the same about data analytics.</p>
                            <p>To draw the line between business intelligence and data analytics, we think it's more useful
                                to talk about what we want to accomplish. We can divide analytics into three categories:
                                descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive.</p> --}}
